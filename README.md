# TextEditor

This is a simple TextEditor in Java that I've built using Lanterna API.
First all You need to do is to add the API jar file into your Java Project:

1) Configure build path -> Add external jar -> locate the API jar file.

2) Add the source jar file to the API jar file.

3) Same thing for the doc jar file.

Just make sure to create a simple text file and put the file's path into Main Class.

That's it !
